      <h3>My story</h3>
      My name is Dane Christensen and I love writing software.
      I am from Boston Massachussetts and from a young age had a fascination with computers.
      When I was 18 I discovered my potential when I began to play around with coding websites
      using HTML, PHP, and MySQL. I made it a personal challenge to myself to make a small 
      social networking site for myself. I've been coding ever since.

      After discovering my passion for coding I started to learn about C++, Java, and a variety
      of other related technologies. Although I now program primarily in C++, I am happy to
      work on a website that will offer further programming experience for the web end where I began.

      <h3>Why Keyboard Cowboys?</h3>
      The term comes from the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/">"Hackers"</a> produced in
      1995. Although the movie is harder to take seriously than a comedy sketch, it offered one reference
      to the new generation of hackers as being "Keyboard Cowboys." I liked the idea and started to work on
      the site. I hope this website will evolve and lend itself as an effective software development resource.
