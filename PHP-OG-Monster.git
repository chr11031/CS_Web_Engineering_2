Most package managers have pretty similar command-line interfaces, including `search`, `install`, `uninstall`. However, some have slightly different commands and functionality, so it always *helps* to run `-h` or `-help` to get familiar with your package manager's UI.

When you run `aptitude -h` the output will also tell you, following a list of valid usage, actions, and options, that aptitude "does not have Super Cow Powers".
```small

Super OS

Super OS (formerly: Super Ubuntu) is a free Linux distribution. It is a modified version of Ubuntu made with reconstructor. Its main goal is to provide an ‘Out of the Box’ experience, containing various enhancements over Ubuntu. It has the goal of remaining compatible with Ubuntu.
The "RUNZ Framework" is a tool that allows the use of portable apps and something called "SuperDebs" (an installer with a .deb file + its dependencies that can be installed offline) in "Super OS". It is already included in "Super OS 9.04 SP 0.1+"

In addition to the official Ubuntu repositories, Super OS also includes its own repositories, which include third-party software like Adobe Reader, Skype, Real Player, TrueCrypt, PeaZip, Google Chrome or Ubuntu calendar, but also include tools/software developed by "hacktolive", like App Runner and RUNZ.
